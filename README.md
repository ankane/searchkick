# Searchkick

:rocket: Intelligent search made easy

Searchkick learns what **your users** are looking for. As more people search, it gets smarter and the results get better. It‚Äôs friendly for developers - and magical for your users.

Searchkick handles:

- stemming - `tomatoes` matches `tomato`
- special characters - `jalapeno` matches `jalape√±o`
- extra whitespace - `dishwasher` matches `dish washer`
- misspellings - `zuchini` matches `zucchini`
- custom synonyms - `qtip` matches `cotton swab`

Plus:

- query like SQL - no need to learn a new query language
- reindex without downtime
- easily personalize results for each user
- autocomplete
- ‚ÄúDid you mean‚Äù suggestions
- works with ActiveRecord, Mongoid, and NoBrainer

:tangerine: Battle-tested at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/opensource)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ankane/searchkick.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ankane/searchkick)

## Get Started

[Install Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html). For Homebrew, use:

```sh
brew install elasticsearch

# start the server
elasticsearch
```

Add this line to your application‚Äôs Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'searchkick'
```

For Elasticsearch 5.0, use the version `1.4` and above. For Elasticsearch 2.0, use the version `1.0` and above.

Add searchkick to models you want to search.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick
end
```

Add data to the search index.

```ruby
Product.reindex
```

And to query, use:

```ruby
products = Product.search "apples"
products.each do |product|
  puts product.name
end
```

Searchkick supports the complete [Elasticsearch Search API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html). As your search becomes more advanced, we recommend you use the [Elasticsearch DSL](#advanced) for maximum flexibility.

### Queries

Query like SQL

```ruby
Product.search "apples", where: {in_stock: true}, limit: 10, offset: 50
```

Search specific fields

```ruby
fields: [:name, :brand]
```

Where

```ruby
where: {
  expires_at: {gt: Time.now}, # lt, gte, lte also available
  orders_count: 1..10,        # equivalent to {gte: 1, lte: 10}
  aisle_id: [25, 30],         # in
  store_id: {not: 2},         # not
  aisle_id: {not: [25, 30]},  # not in
  user_ids: {all: [1, 3]},    # all elements in array
  category: /frozen .+/,      # regexp
  or: [
    [{in_stock: true}, {backordered: true}]
  ]
}
```

Order

```ruby
order: {_score: :desc} # most relevant first - default
```

[All of these sort options are supported](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-sort.html)

Limit / offset

```ruby
limit: 20, offset: 40
```

Select

```ruby
select_v2: ["name"]
```

### Results

Searches return a `Searchkick::Results` object. This responds like an array to most methods.

```ruby
results = Product.search("milk")
results.size
results.any?
results.each { |result| ... }
```

By default, ids are fetched from Elasticsearch and records are fetched from your database. To fetch everything from Elasticsearch, use:

```ruby
Product.search("apples", load: false)
```

Get total results

```ruby
results.total_count
```

Get the time the search took (in milliseconds)

```ruby
results.took
```

Get the full response from Elasticsearch

```ruby
results.response
```

### Boosting

Boost important fields

```ruby
fields: ["title^10", "description"]
```

Boost by the value of a field (field must be numeric)

```ruby
boost_by: [:orders_count] # give popular documents a little boost
boost_by: {orders_count: {factor: 10}} # default factor is 1
```

Boost matching documents

```ruby
boost_where: {user_id: 1}
boost_where: {user_id: {value: 1, factor: 100}} # default factor is 1000
boost_where: {user_id: [{value: 1, factor: 100}, {value: 2, factor: 200}]}
```

[Conversions](#keep-getting-better) are also a great way to boost.

### Get Everything

Use a `*` for the query.

```ruby
Product.search "*"
```

### Pagination

Plays nicely with kaminari and will_paginate.

```ruby
# controller
@products = Product.search "milk", page: params[:page], per_page: 20
```

View with kaminari

```erb
<%= paginate @products %>
```

View with will_paginate

```erb
<%= will_paginate @products %>
```

### Partial Matches

By default, results must match all words in the query.

```ruby
Product.search "fresh honey" # fresh AND honey
```

To change this, use:

```ruby
Product.search "fresh honey", operator: "or" # fresh OR honey
```

By default, results must match the entire word - `back` will not match `backpack`. You can change this behavior with:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick word_start: [:name]
end
```

And to search (after you reindex):

```ruby
Product.search "back", fields: [:name], match: :word_start
```

Available options are:

```ruby
:word # default
:word_start
:word_middle
:word_end
:text_start
:text_middle
:text_end
```

### Exact Matches

```ruby
User.search params[:q], fields: [{email: :exact}, :name]
```

### Phrase Matches

```ruby
User.search "fresh honey", match: :phrase
```

### Language

Searchkick defaults to English for stemming. To change this, use:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick language: "german"
end
```

[See the list of stemmers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-stemmer-tokenfilter.html)

### Synonyms

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick synonyms: [["scallion", "green onion"], ["qtip", "cotton swab"]]
  # or
  # searchkick synonyms: -> { CSV.read("/some/path/synonyms.csv") }
end
```

Call `Product.reindex` after changing synonyms.

### WordNet

Prepopulate English synonyms with the [WordNet database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet).

Download [WordNet 3.0](http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WNprolog-3.0.tar.gz) to each Elasticsearch server and move `wn_s.pl` to the `/var/lib` directory.

```sh
cd /tmp
curl -o wordnet.tar.gz http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WNprolog-3.0.tar.gz
tar -zxvf wordnet.tar.gz
mv prolog/wn_s.pl /var/lib
```

Tell each model to use it:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick wordnet: true
end
```

### Misspellings

By default, Searchkick handles misspelled queries by returning results with an [edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) of one.

You can change this with:

```ruby
Product.search "zucini", misspellings: {edit_distance: 2} # zucchini
```

To improve performance for correctly spelled queries (which should be a majority for most applications), Searchkick can first perform a search without misspellings, and if there are too few results, perform another with them.

```ruby
Product.search "zuchini", misspellings: {below: 5}
```

If there are fewer than 5 results, a 2nd search is performed with misspellings enabled. The result of this query is returned.

Turn off misspellings with:

```ruby
Product.search "zuchini", misspellings: false # no zucchini
```

### Emoji

Search :ice_cream::cake: and get `ice cream cake`!

Add this line to your application‚Äôs Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gemoji-parser'
```

And use:

```ruby
Product.search "üç®üç∞", emoji: true
```

### Indexing

Control what data is indexed with the `search_data` method. Call `Product.reindex` after changing this method.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :department

  def search_data
    {
      name: name,
      department_name: department.name,
      on_sale: sale_price.present?
    }
  end
end
```

Searchkick uses `find_in_batches` to import documents. To eager load associations, use the `search_import` scope.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :search_import, -> { includes(:department) }
end
```

By default, all records are indexed. To control which records are indexed, use the `should_index?` method together with the `search_import` scope.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :search_import, -> { where(active: true) }

  def should_index?
    active # only index active records
  end
end
```

If a reindex is interrupted, you can resume it with:

```ruby
Product.reindex(resume: true)
```

### To Reindex, or Not to Reindex

#### Reindex

- when you install or upgrade searchkick
- change the `search_data` method
- change the `searchkick` method

#### No need to reindex

- App starts

### Stay Synced

There are three strategies for keeping the index synced with your database.

1. Immediate (default)

  Anytime a record is inserted, updated, or deleted

2. Asynchronous

  Use background jobs for better performance

  ```ruby
  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    searchkick callbacks: :async
  end
  ```

  And [install Active Job](https://github.com/ankane/activejob_backport) for Rails 4.1 and below. Jobs are added to a queue named `searchkick`.

3. Manual

  Turn off automatic syncing

  ```ruby
  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    searchkick callbacks: false
  end
  ```

You can also do bulk updates.

```ruby
Searchkick.callbacks(:bulk) do
  User.find_each(&:update_fields)
end
```

Or temporarily skip updates.

```ruby
Searchkick.callbacks(false) do
  User.find_each(&:update_fields)
end
```

#### Associations

Data is **not** automatically synced when an association is updated. If this is desired, add a callback to reindex:

```ruby
class Image < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :product

  after_commit :reindex_product

  def reindex_product
    product.reindex # or reindex_async
  end
end
```

### Analytics

We highly recommend tracking searches and conversions.

[Searchjoy](https://github.com/ankane/searchjoy) makes it easy.

```ruby
Product.search "apple", track: {user_id: current_user.id}
```

[See the docs](https://github.com/ankane/searchjoy) for how to install and use.

### Keep Getting Better

Searchkick can use conversion data to learn what users are looking for. If a user searches for ‚Äúice cream‚Äù and adds Ben & Jerry‚Äôs Chunky Monkey to the cart (our conversion metric at Instacart), that item gets a little more weight for similar searches.

The first step is to define your conversion metric and start tracking conversions. The database works well for low volume, but feel free to use Redis or another datastore.

You do **not** need to clean up the search queries. Searchkick automatically treats `apple` and `APPLES` the same.

Next, add conversions to the index.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :searches, class_name: "Searchjoy::Search", as: :convertable

  searchkick conversions: ["conversions"] # name of field

  def search_data
    {
      name: name,
      conversions: searches.group(:query).uniq.count(:user_id)
      # {"ice cream" => 234, "chocolate" => 67, "cream" => 2}
    }
  end
end
```

Reindex and set up a cron job to add new conversions daily.

```ruby
rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Product
```

### Personalized Results

Order results differently for each user. For example, show a user‚Äôs previously purchased products before other results.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  def search_data
    {
      name: name,
      orderer_ids: orders.pluck(:user_id) # boost this product for these users
    }
  end
end
```

Reindex and search with:

```ruby
Product.search "milk", boost_where: {orderer_ids: current_user.id}
```

### Instant Search / Autocomplete

Autocomplete predicts what a user will type, making the search experience faster and easier.

![Autocomplete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankane/searchkick/gh-pages/autocomplete.png)

**Note:** If you only have a few thousand records, don‚Äôt use Searchkick for autocomplete. It‚Äôs *much* faster to load all records into JavaScript and autocomplete there (eliminates network requests).

First, specify which fields use this feature. This is necessary since autocomplete can increase the index size significantly, but don‚Äôt worry - this gives you blazing faster queries.

```ruby
class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick word_start: [:title, :author]
end
```

Reindex and search with:

```ruby
Book.search "tipping poi"
```

Typically, you want to use a JavaScript library like [typeahead.js](http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/) or [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/).

#### Here‚Äôs how to make it work with Rails

First, add a route and controller action.

```ruby
# app/controllers/books_controller.rb
class BooksController < ApplicationController
  def autocomplete
    render json: Book.search(params[:query], {
      fields: ["title^5", "author"],
      match: :word_start,
      limit: 10,
      load: false,
      misspellings: {below: 5}
    }).map(&:title)
  end
end
```

Then add the search box and JavaScript code to a view.

```html
<input type="text" id="query" name="query" />

<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="typeahead.bundle.js"></script>
<script>
  var books = new Bloodhound({
    datumTokenizer: Bloodhound.tokenizers.whitespace,
    queryTokenizer: Bloodhound.tokenizers.whitespace,
    remote: {
      url: '/books/autocomplete?query=%QUERY',
      wildcard: '%QUERY'
    }
  });
  $('#query').typeahead(null, {
    source: books
  });
</script>
```

### Suggestions

![Suggest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankane/searchkick/gh-pages/recursion.png)

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick suggest: [:name] # fields to generate suggestions
end
```

Reindex and search with:

```ruby
products = Product.search "peantu butta", suggest: true
products.suggestions # ["peanut butter"]
```

### Aggregations

[Aggregations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html) provide aggregated search data.

![Aggregations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankane/searchkick/gh-pages/facets.png)

```ruby
products = Product.search "chuck taylor", aggs: [:product_type, :gender, :brand]
products.aggs
```

By default, `where` conditions apply to aggregations.

```ruby
Product.search "wingtips", where: {color: "brandy"}, aggs: [:size]
# aggregations for brandy wingtips are returned
```

Change this with:

```ruby
Product.search "wingtips", where: {color: "brandy"}, aggs: [:size], smart_aggs: false
# aggregations for all wingtips are returned
```

Set `where` conditions for each aggregation separately with:

```ruby
Product.search "wingtips", aggs: {size: {where: {color: "brandy"}}}
```

Limit

```ruby
Product.search "apples", aggs: {store_id: {limit: 10}}
```

Order

```ruby
Product.search "wingtips", aggs: {color: {order: {"_term" => "asc"}}} # alphabetically
```

[All of these options are supported](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation-order)

Ranges

```ruby
price_ranges = [{to: 20}, {from: 20, to: 50}, {from: 50}]
Product.search "*", aggs: {price: {ranges: price_ranges}}
```

Minimum document count

```ruby
Product.search "apples", aggs: {store_id: {min_doc_count: 2}}
```

Date histogram

```ruby
Product.search "pear", aggs: {products_per_year: {date_histogram: {field: :created_at, interval: :year}}}
```

#### Moving From Facets

1. Replace `facets` with `aggs` in searches. **Note:** Stats facets are not supported at this time.

  ```ruby
  products = Product.search "chuck taylor", facets: [:brand]
  # to
  products = Product.search "chuck taylor", aggs: [:brand]
  ```

2. Replace the `facets` method with `aggs` for results.

  ```ruby
  products.facets
  # to
  products.aggs
  ```

  The keys in results differ slightly. Instead of:

  ```json
  {
    "_type":"terms",
    "missing":0,
    "total":45,
    "other":34,
    "terms":[
      {"term":14.0,"count":11}
    ]
  }
  ```

  You get:

  ```json
  {
    "doc_count":45,
    "doc_count_error_upper_bound":0,
    "sum_other_doc_count":34,
    "buckets":[
      {"key":14.0,"doc_count":11}
    ]
  }
  ```

  Update your application to handle this.

3. By default, `where` conditions apply to aggregations. This is equivalent to `smart_facets: true`. If you have `smart_facets: true`, you can remove it. If this is not desired, set `smart_aggs: false`.

4. If you have any range facets with dates, change the key from `ranges` to `date_ranges`.

  ```ruby
  facets: {date_field: {ranges: date_ranges}}
  # to
  aggs: {date_field: {date_ranges: date_ranges}}
  ```

### Facets [deprecated]

Facets have been deprecated in favor of aggregations as of Searchkick 1.0. See [how to upgrade](#moving-from-facets).

```ruby
products = Product.search "chuck taylor", facets: [:product_type, :gender, :brand]
p products.facets
```

By default, `where` conditions are not applied to facets (for backward compatibility).

```ruby
Product.search "wingtips", where: {color: "brandy"}, facets: [:size]
# facets *not* filtered by color :(
```

Change this with:

```ruby
Product.search "wingtips", where: {color: "brandy"}, facets: [:size], smart_facets: true
```

or set `where` conditions for each facet separately:

```ruby
Product.search "wingtips", facets: {size: {where: {color: "brandy"}}}
```

Limit

```ruby
Product.search "apples", facets: {store_id: {limit: 10}}
```

Ranges

```ruby
price_ranges = [{to: 20}, {from: 20, to: 50}, {from: 50}]
Product.search "*", facets: {price: {ranges: price_ranges}}
```

Use the `stats` option to get to max, min, mean, and total scores for each facet

```ruby
Product.search "*", facets: {store_id: {stats: true}}
```

### Highlight

Specify which fields to index with highlighting.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick highlight: [:name]
end
```

Highlight the search query in the results.

```ruby
bands = Band.search "cinema", fields: [:name], highlight: true
```

**Note:** The `fields` option is required, unless highlight options are given - see below.

View the highlighted fields with:

```ruby
bands.with_details.each do |band, details|
  puts details[:highlight][:name] # "Two Door <em>Cinema</em> Club"
end
```

To change the tag, use:

```ruby
Band.search "cinema", fields: [:name], highlight: {tag: "<strong>"}
```

To highlight and search different fields, use:

```ruby
Band.search "cinema", fields: [:name], highlight: {fields: [:description]}
```

Additional options, including fragment size, can be specified for each field:

```ruby
Band.search "cinema", fields: [:name], highlight: {fields: {name: {fragment_size: 200}}}
```

You can find available highlight options in the [Elasticsearch reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-highlighting.html#_highlighted_fragments).

### Similar Items

Find similar items.

```ruby
product = Product.first
product.similar(fields: ["name"], where: {size: "12 oz"})
```

### Geospatial Searches

```ruby
class City < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick locations: ["location"]

  def search_data
    attributes.merge location: {lat: latitude, lon: longitude}
  end
end
```

Reindex and search with:

```ruby
City.search "san", where: {location: {near: {lat: 37, lon: -114}, within: "100mi"}} # or 160km
```

Bounded by a box

```ruby
City.search "san", where: {location: {top_left: {lat: 38, lon: -123}, bottom_right: {lat: 37, lon: -122}}}
```

Bounded by a polygon [master]

```ruby
City.search "san", where: {location: {geo_polygon: {points: [{lat: 38, lon: -123}, {lat: 39, lon: -123}, {lat: 37, lon: 122}]}}}
```

### Boost By Distance

Boost results by distance - closer results are boosted more

```ruby
City.search "san", boost_by_distance: {field: :location, origin: {lat: 37, lon: -122}}
```

Also supports [additional options](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-function-score-query.html#_decay_functions)

```ruby
City.search "san", boost_by_distance: {field: :location, origin: {lat: 37, lon: -122}, function: :linear, scale: "30mi", decay: 0.5}
```

### Routing

Searchkick supports [Elasticsearch‚Äôs routing feature](https://www.elastic.co/blog/customizing-your-document-routing).

```ruby
class Business < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick routing: true

  def search_routing
    city_id
  end
end
```

Reindex and search with:

```ruby
Business.search "ice cream", routing: params[:city_id]
```

## Inheritance

Searchkick supports single table inheritance.

```ruby
class Dog < Animal
end
```

The parent and child model can both reindex.

```ruby
Animal.reindex
Dog.reindex # equivalent
```

And to search, use:

```ruby
Animal.search "*"                   # all animals
Dog.search "*"                      # just dogs
Animal.search "*", type: [Dog, Cat] # just cats and dogs
```

**Note:** The `suggest` option retrieves suggestions from the parent at the moment.

```ruby
Dog.search "airbudd", suggest: true # suggestions for all animals
```

## Debugging Queries

See how Elasticsearch scores your queries with:

```ruby
Product.search("soap", explain: true).response
```

See how Elasticsearch tokenizes your queries with:

```ruby
Product.searchkick_index.tokens("Dish Washer Soap", analyzer: "default_index")
# ["dish", "dishwash", "washer", "washersoap", "soap"]

Product.searchkick_index.tokens("dishwasher soap", analyzer: "searchkick_search")
# ["dishwashersoap"] - no match

Product.searchkick_index.tokens("dishwasher soap", analyzer: "searchkick_search2")
# ["dishwash", "soap"] - match!!
```

Partial matches

```ruby
Product.searchkick_index.tokens("San Diego", analyzer: "searchkick_word_start_index")
# ["s", "sa", "san", "d", "di", "die", "dieg", "diego"]

Product.searchkick_index.tokens("dieg", analyzer: "searchkick_word_search")
# ["dieg"] - match!!
```

See the [complete list of analyzers](lib/searchkick/index.rb#L209).

## Deployment

Searchkick uses `ENV["ELASTICSEARCH_URL"]` for the Elasticsearch server. This defaults to `http://localhost:9200`.

### Heroku

Choose an add-on: [SearchBox](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/searchbox), [Bonsai](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/bonsai), or [Elastic Cloud](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/foundelasticsearch).

```sh
# SearchBox
heroku addons:create searchbox:starter
heroku config:set ELASTICSEARCH_URL=`heroku config:get SEARCHBOX_URL`

# Bonsai
heroku addons:create bonsai
heroku config:set ELASTICSEARCH_URL=`heroku config:get BONSAI_URL`

# Found
heroku addons:create foundelasticsearch
heroku config:set ELASTICSEARCH_URL=`heroku config:get FOUNDELASTICSEARCH_URL`
```

Then deploy and reindex:

```sh
heroku run rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Product
```

### Amazon Elasticsearch Service

Include `elasticsearch 1.0.15` or greater in your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem "elasticsearch", ">= 1.0.15"
```

Create an initializer `config/initializers/elasticsearch.rb` with:

```ruby
ENV["ELASTICSEARCH_URL"] = "https://es-domain-1234.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com"
```

To use signed request, include in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'faraday_middleware-aws-signers-v4'
```

and add to your initializer:

```ruby
require "faraday_middleware/aws_signers_v4"
Searchkick.client =
  Elasticsearch::Client.new(
    url: ENV["ELASTICSEARCH_URL"],
    transport_options: {request: {timeout: 10}}
  ) do |f|
    f.request :aws_signers_v4, {
      credentials: Aws::Credentials.new(ENV["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"], ENV["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"]),
      service_name: "es",
      region: "us-east-1"
    }
  end
```

Then deploy and reindex:

```sh
rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Product
```

### Other

Create an initializer `config/initializers/elasticsearch.rb` with:

```ruby
ENV["ELASTICSEARCH_URL"] = "http://username:password@api.searchbox.io"
```

Then deploy and reindex:

```sh
rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Product
```

### Performance

For the best performance, add [Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus) to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'typhoeus'
```

And create an initializer with:

```ruby
require "typhoeus/adapters/faraday"
Ethon.logger.level = Logger::WARN
```

### Automatic Failover

Create an initializer `config/initializers/elasticsearch.rb` with multiple hosts:

```ruby
Searchkick.client = Elasticsearch::Client.new(hosts: ["localhost:9200", "localhost:9201"], retry_on_failure: true)
```

See [elasticsearch-transport](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/blob/master/elasticsearch-transport) for a complete list of options.

### Lograge

Add the following to `config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.lograge.custom_options = lambda do |event|
  options = {}
  options[:search] = event.payload[:searchkick_runtime] if event.payload[:searchkick_runtime].to_f > 0
  options
end
```

See [Production Rails](https://github.com/ankane/production_rails) for other good practices.

## Advanced

Prefer to use the [Elasticsearch DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-queries.html) but still want awesome features like zero-downtime reindexing?

### Advanced Mapping

Create a custom mapping:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick mappings: {
    product: {
      properties: {
        name: {type: "string", analyzer: "keyword"}
      }
    }
  }
end
```
**Note:** If you use a custom mapping, you'll need to use [custom searching](#advanced-search) as well.

To keep the mappings and settings generated by Searchkick, use:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick merge_mappings: true, mappings: {...}
end
```

### Advanced Search

And use the `body` option to search:

```ruby
products = Product.search body: {match: {name: "milk"}}
```

**Note:** This replaces the entire body, so other options are ignored.

View the response with:

```ruby
products.response
```

To modify the query generated by Searchkick, use:

```ruby
products = Product.search "milk", body_options: {min_score: 1}
```

or

```ruby
products =
  Product.search "apples" do |body|
    body[:min_score] = 1
  end
```

## Multi Search

To batch search requests for performance, use:

```ruby
fresh_products = Product.search("fresh", execute: false)
frozen_products = Product.search("frozen", execute: false)
Searchkick.multi_search([fresh_products, frozen_products])
```

Then use `fresh_products` and `frozen_products` as typical results.

**Note:** Errors are not raised as with single requests. Use the `error` method on each query to check for errors. Also, if you use the `below` option for misspellings, misspellings will be disabled.

## Multiple Indices

Search across multiple indices with:

```ruby
Searchkick.search "milk", index_name: [Product, Category]
```

Boost specific indices with:

```ruby
indices_boost: {Category => 2, Product => 1}
```

## Nested Data

To query nested data, use dot notation.

```ruby
User.search "*", where: {"address.zip_code" => 12345}
```

## Reference

Reindex one record

```ruby
product = Product.find 10
product.reindex
# or to reindex in the background
product.reindex_async
```

Reindex more than one record without recreating the index

```ruby
# do this ...
some_company.products.each { |p| p.reindex }
# or this ...
Product.searchkick_index.import(some_company.products)
# don't do the following as it will recreate the index with some_company's products only
some_company.products.reindex
```

Reindex large set of records in batches

```ruby
Product.where("id > 100000").find_in_batches do |batch|
  Product.searchkick_index.import(batch)
end
```

Remove old indices

```ruby
Product.clean_indices
```

Use custom settings

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick settings: {number_of_shards: 3}
end
```

Use a different index name

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick index_name: "products_v2"
end
```

Use a dynamic index name

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick index_name: -> { "#{name.tableize}-#{I18n.locale}" }
end
```

Prefix the index name

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick index_prefix: "datakick"
end
```

Multiple conversion fields

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :searches, class_name: "Searchjoy::Search"

  # searchkick also supports multiple "conversions" fields
  searchkick conversions: ["unique_user_conversions", "total_conversions"]

  def search_data
    {
      name: name,
      unique_user_conversions: searches.group(:query).uniq.count(:user_id)
      # {"ice cream" => 234, "chocolate" => 67, "cream" => 2}
      total_conversions: searches.group(:query).count
      # {"ice cream" => 412, "chocolate" => 117, "cream" => 6}
    }
  end
end
```

and during query time:

```ruby
Product.search("banana") # boost by both fields (default)
Product.search("banana", conversions: "total_conversions") # only boost by total_conversions
Product.search("banana", conversions: false) # no conversion boosting
```

Change timeout

```ruby
Searchkick.timeout = 15 # defaults to 10
```

Set a lower timeout for searches

```ruby
Searchkick.search_timeout = 3
```

Change the search method name in `config/initializers/searchkick.rb`

```ruby
Searchkick.search_method_name = :lookup
```

Eager load associations

```ruby
Product.search "milk", includes: [:brand, :stores]
```

Turn off special characters

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  # A will not match √Ñ
  searchkick special_characters: false
end
```

Use [Okapi BM25](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/pluggable-similarites.html) for ranking

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick similarity: "BM25"
end
```

Change import batch size

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick batch_size: 200 # defaults to 1000
end
```

Create index without importing

```ruby
Product.reindex(import: false)
```

Lazy searching

```ruby
products = Product.search("carrots", execute: false)
products.each { ... } # search not executed until here
```

Add [request parameters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-uri-request.html), like `search_type` and `query_cache`

```ruby
Product.search("carrots", request_params: {search_type: "dfs_query_then_fetch"})
```

Make fields unsearchable but include in the source

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick unsearchable: [:color]
end
```

Reindex conditionally

**Note:** With ActiveRecord, use this feature with caution - [transaction rollbacks can cause data inconsistencies](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails/blob/master/elasticsearch-model/README.md#custom-callbacks)

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick callbacks: false

  # add the callbacks manually
  after_save :reindex, if: proc{|model| model.name_changed? } # use your own condition
  after_destroy :reindex
end
```

Reindex all models - Rails only

```sh
rake searchkick:reindex:all
```

Turn on misspellings after a certain number of characters

```ruby
Product.search "api", misspellings: {prefix_length: 2} # api, apt, no ahi
```

**Note:** With this option, if the query length is the same as `prefix_length`, misspellings are turned off

```ruby
Product.search "ah", misspellings: {prefix_length: 2} # ah, no aha
```

## Large Data Sets

For large data sets, check out [Keeping Elasticsearch in Sync](https://www.elastic.co/blog/found-keeping-elasticsearch-in-sync). Searchkick will make this easy in the future.

## Testing

This section could use some love.

### RSpec

```ruby
describe Product do
  it "searches" do
    Product.reindex
    Product.searchkick_index.refresh # don't forget this
    # test goes here...
  end
end
```

### Factory Girl

```ruby
product = FactoryGirl.create(:product)
product.reindex # don't forget this
Product.searchkick_index.refresh # or this
```

## Multi-Tenancy

Check out [this great post](https://www.tiagoamaro.com.br/2014/12/11/multi-tenancy-with-searchkick/) on the [Apartment](https://github.com/influitive/apartment) gem. Follow a similar pattern if you use another gem.

## Migrating from Tire

1. Change `search` methods to `tire.search` and add index name in existing search calls

  ```ruby
  Product.search "fruit"
  ```

  should be replaced with

  ```ruby
  Product.tire.search "fruit", index: "products"
  ```

2. Replace tire mapping w/ searchkick method

  ```ruby
  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    searchkick
  end
  ```

3. Deploy and reindex

  ```ruby
  rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Product # or Product.reindex in the console
  ```

4. Once it finishes, replace search calls w/ searchkick calls

## Upgrading

View the [changelog](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Important notes are listed below.

### 1.0.0

- Added support for Elasticsearch 2.0
- Facets are deprecated in favor of [aggregations](#aggregations) - see [how to upgrade](#moving-from-facets)

#### Breaking Changes

- **ActiveRecord 4.1+ and Mongoid 3+:** Attempting to reindex with a scope now throws a `Searchkick::DangerousOperation` error to keep your from accidentally recreating your index with only a few records.

  ```ruby
  Product.where(color: "brandy").reindex # error!
  ```

  If this is what you intend to do, use:

  ```ruby
  Product.where(color: "brandy").reindex(accept_danger: true)
  ```

- Misspellings are enabled by default for [partial matches](#partial-matches). Use `misspellings: false` to disable.
- [Transpositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance) are enabled by default for misspellings. Use `misspellings: {transpositions: false}` to disable.

### 0.6.0 and 0.7.0

If running Searchkick `0.6.0` or `0.7.0` and Elasticsearch `0.90`, we recommend upgrading to Searchkick `0.6.1` or `0.7.1` to fix an issue that causes downtime when reindexing.

### 0.3.0

Before `0.3.0`, locations were indexed incorrectly. When upgrading, be sure to reindex immediately.

## Elasticsearch Gotchas

### Inconsistent Scores

Due to the distributed nature of Elasticsearch, you can get incorrect results when the number of documents in the index is low. You can [read more about it here](https://www.elastic.co/blog/understanding-query-then-fetch-vs-dfs-query-then-fetch). To fix this, do:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick settings: {number_of_shards: 1}
end
```

For convenience, this is set by default in the test environment.
