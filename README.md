# Searchkick

:rocket: Intelligent search made easy

Searchkick learns what **your users** are looking for.  As more people search, it gets smarter and the results get better.  It’s friendly for developers - and magical for your users.

Searchkick handles:

- stemming - `tomatoes` matches `tomato`
- special characters - `jalapeno` matches `jalapeño`
- extra whitespace - `dishwasher` matches `dish washer`
- misspellings - `zuchini` matches `zucchini`
- custom synonyms - `qtip` matches `cotton swab`

Plus:

- query like SQL - no need to learn a new query language
- reindex without downtime
- easily personalize results for each user
- autocomplete
- “Did you mean” suggestions
- works with ActiveRecord and Mongoid

:tangerine: Battle-tested at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ankane/searchkick.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ankane/searchkick)

## Get Started

[Install Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/setup/installation/). For Homebrew, use:

```sh
brew install elasticsearch
```

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "searchkick"
```

Add searchkick to models you want to search.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick
end
```

Add data to the search index.

```ruby
Product.reindex
```

And to query, use:

```ruby
products = Product.search "2% Milk"
products.each do |product|
  puts product.name
end
```

### Queries

Query like SQL

```ruby
Product.search "2% Milk", where: {in_stock: true}, limit: 10, offset: 50
```

Search specific fields

```ruby
fields: [:name, :brand]
```

Where

```ruby
where: {
  expires_at: {gt: Time.now}, # lt, gte, lte also available
  orders_count: 1..10,        # equivalent to {gte: 1, lte: 10}
  aisle_id: [25, 30],         # in
  store_id: {not: 2},         # not
  aisle_id: {not: [25, 30]},  # not in
  or: [
    [{in_stock: true}, {backordered: true}]
  ]
}
```

Order

```ruby
order: {_score: :desc} # most relevant first - default
```

Limit / offset

```ruby
limit: 20, offset: 40
```

Boost by a field

```ruby
boost: "orders_count" # give popular documents a little boost
```

### Pagination

Plays nicely with kaminari and will_paginate.

```ruby
# controller
@products = Product.search "milk", page: params[:page], per_page: 20

# view
<%= paginate @products %>
```

### Partial Matches

By default, results must match all words in the query.

```ruby
Product.search "fresh honey" # fresh AND honey
```

To change this, use:

```ruby
Product.search "fresh honey", partial: true # fresh OR honey
```

### Synonyms

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick synonyms: [["scallion", "green onion"], ["qtip", "cotton swab"]]
end
```

Call `Product.reindex` after changing synonyms.

### Indexing

Control what data is indexed with the `search_data` method. Call `Product.reindex` after changing this method.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  def search_data
    as_json only: [:name, :active]
    # or equivalently
    {
      name: name,
      active: active
    }
  end
end
```

Searchkick uses `find_in_batches` to import documents.  To eager load associations, use the `search_import` scope.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :search_import, includes(:searches)
end
```

### To Reindex, or Not to Reindex

#### Reindex

- when you install or upgrade searchkick
- change the `search_data` method
- change the `searchkick` method

#### No need to reindex

- App starts
- Records are inserted, updated or deleted (syncs automatically)

### Keep Getting Better

Searchkick uses conversion data to learn what users are looking for.  If a user searches for “ice cream” and adds Ben & Jerry’s Chunky Monkey to the cart (our conversion metric at Instacart), that item gets a little more weight for similar searches.

The first step is to define your conversion metric and start tracking conversions.  The database works well for low volume, but feel free to use Redis or another datastore.

```ruby
class Search < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :product
  # fields: id, query, searched_at, converted_at, product_id
end
```

You do **not** need to clean up the search queries.  Searchkick automatically treats `apple` and `APPLES` the same.

Next, add conversions to the index.  You must specify the conversions field as of version `0.2.0`.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :searches

  searchkick conversions: "conversions" # name of field

  def search_data
    {
      name: name,
      conversions: searches.group("query").count
      # {"ice cream" => 234, "chocolate" => 67, "cream" => 2}
    }
  end
end
```

Reindex and set up a cron job to add new conversions daily.

```ruby
rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Product
```

### Personalized Results

Order results differently for each user.  For example, show a user’s previously purchased products before other results.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick personalize: "user_ids"

  def search_data
    {
      name: name,
      user_ids: orders.pluck(:user_id) # boost this product for these users
      # [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
    }
  end
end
```

Reindex and search with:

```ruby
Product.search "milk", user_id: 8
```

### Autocomplete

Autocomplete predicts what a user will type, making the search experience faster and easier.

![Autocomplete](http://ankane.github.io/searchkick/autocomplete.png)

First, specify which fields use this feature.  This is necessary since autocomplete can increase the index size significantly, but don’t worry - this gives you blazing faster queries.

```ruby
class City < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick autocomplete: ["name"]
end
```

Reindex and search with:

```ruby
City.search "san fr", autocomplete: true
```

Typically, you want to use a Javascript library like [typeahead.js](http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/) or [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/).

### Fuzzy Search

By default, `searchkick` will return results that match within one character of misspelling. To turn off this feature, supply the `misspelling: false` option.

```ruby
Word.all
#=> ["red", "bed"]
Word.search "red"
#=> ["red", "bed"]
Word.search "red", misspelling: false
#=> ["red"]
```

#### Here’s how to make it work with Rails

First, add a controller action.

```ruby
# app/controllers/cities_controller.rb
class CitiesController < ApplicationController

  def autocomplete
    render json: City.search(params[:query], autocomplete: true, limit: 10).map(&:name)
  end

end
```

Then add the search box and Javascript code to a view.

```html
<input type="text" id="query" name="query" />

<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="typeahead.js"></script>
<script>
  $("#query").typeahead({
    name: "city",
    remote: "/cities/autocomplete?query=%QUERY"
  });
</script>
```

### Suggestions

![Suggest](http://ankane.github.io/searchkick/recursion.png)

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick suggest: ["name"] # fields to generate suggestions
end
```

Reindex and search with:

```ruby
products = Product.search "peantu butta", suggest: true
products.suggestions # ["peanut butter"]
```

### Facets

[Facets](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/facets/) provide aggregated search data.

![Facets](http://ankane.github.io/searchkick/facets.png)

```ruby
products = Product.search "chuck taylor", facets: [:product_type, :gender, :brand]
p products.facets
```

Advanced

```ruby
Product.search "2% Milk", facets: {store_id: {where: {in_stock: true}}}
```

### Similar Items

Find similar items.

```ruby
product = Product.first
product.similar(fields: ["name"])
```

### Geospatial Searches

```ruby
class City < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick locations: ["location"]

  def search_data
    to_hash.merge location: [latitude.to_f, longitude.to_f]
  end
end
```

Reindex and search with:

```ruby
City.search "san", where: {location: {near: [37, -114], within: "100mi"}} # or 160km
```

## Deployment

Searchkick uses `ENV["ELASTICSEARCH_URL"]` for the Elasticsearch server.  This defaults to `http://localhost:9200`.

### Heroku

Choose an add-on: [SearchBox](https://addons.heroku.com/searchbox), [Bonsai](https://addons.heroku.com/bonsai), or [Found](https://addons.heroku.com/foundelasticsearch).

```sh
# SearchBox
heroku addons:add searchbox:starter
heroku config:add ELASTICSEARCH_URL=`heroku config:get SEARCHBOX_URL`

# Bonsai
heroku addons:add bonsai
heroku config:add ELASTICSEARCH_URL=`heroku config:get BONSAI_URL`

# Found
heroku addons:add foundelasticsearch
heroku config:add ELASTICSEARCH_URL=`heroku config:get FOUNDELASTICSEARCH_URL`
```

Then deploy and reindex:

```sh
heroku run rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Product
```

### Other

Create an initializer `config/initializers/elasticsearch.rb` with:

```ruby
ENV["ELASTICSEARCH_URL"] = "http://username:password@api.searchbox.io"
```

Then deploy and reindex:

```sh
heroku run rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Product
```

## Reference

Searchkick requires Elasticsearch `0.90.0` or higher.

Reindex one record

```ruby
product = Product.find 10
product.reindex
```

Remove old indices

```ruby
Product.clean_indices
```

Use a different index name

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick index_name: "products_v2"
end
```

Eagar load associations

```ruby
Product.search "milk", include: [:brand, :stores]
```

Do not load models

```ruby
Product.search "milk", load: false
```

Reindex all models (Rails only)

```sh
rake searchkick:reindex:all
```

## Migrating from Tire

1. Change `search` methods to `tire.search` and add index name in existing search calls

  ```ruby
  Product.search "fruit"
  ```

  should be replaced with

  ```ruby
  Product.tire.search "fruit", index: "products"
  ```

2. Replace tire mapping w/ searchkick method

  ```ruby
  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
      searchkick
  end
  ```

3. Deploy and reindex

  ```ruby
  rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Product # or Product.reindex in the console
  ```

4. Once it finishes, replace search calls w/ searchkick calls

## Elasticsearch Gotchas

### Inconsistent Scores

Due to the distributed nature of Elasticsearch, you can get incorrect results when the number of documents in the index is low.  You can [read more about it here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/understanding-query-then-fetch-vs-dfs-query-then-fetch/).  To fix this, do:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchkick settings: {number_of_shards: 1}
end
```

For convenience, this is set by default in the test environment.
